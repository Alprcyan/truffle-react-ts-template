React Typescript Ethereum DApp Template
---
A preliminary template for React DApps

Before I package it into a *truffle box*, this repo serves as a template for new DApp projects.

# Features
- Truffle setup
- Webpack setup
- React v16
- Typescript
- Solidity

# Building
- `npm run migrate` to build and migrate your contracts
  - Or `npx truffle migrate`. Either way you need to migrate your contracts before building
- `npm run build` to build the DApp
